## Beta Theta Pies
https://a2-lfoley7.glitch.me/

Every year, my fraternity Beta Theta Pi runs our Beta Theta Pies event, where we make pizza pies in our kitchen and sell them to campus. I was in charge of running the event this C term, and I wished that I had a website! This was the perfect opportunity to create one, and after making some changes, our fraternity plans to use this site in future years of the event. I used CSS flexbox, as well as rem- and percentage-based positioning and Bootstrap. To use this web application, make sure to fill out all of the required fields and submit your order! From the modal you can make a new order or view all orders. You can also view all orders from the nav. Do not actually Venmo me money as the field asks!

## Technical Achievements
- **jQuery Implementation**: This webpage uses jQuery to detect when buttons are pressed and forms are submitted to create the appropriate response.
- **Form Validation**: This website correctly uses HTML form validation to make sure that only forms with the required field inputted are submitted
- **Node.js FS**: Uses the Node.js File System library to read and write data from the server and to the table

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **BootStrap Implementation**: This webpage uses Bootstrap for proper formatting and for element styling. Aspects of Bootstrap that are used include Bootstrap modals and buttons, as well as Bootstrap grid positioning.
- **Google Poppins Font**: This website uses the Google Poppins font throughout the website for a more elegant display.
- **Pizza Creator**: The pizza creator is a fun tool for users to create their own pizza and see it displayed on the screen. The original pizza creator was created by Tim Winters, a former Beta and CS student at WPI at the original and now defunct [Beta Theta Pies Website](https://github.com/betathetapiwpi/BetaThetaPies). I refactored some of his code and changed the display of it so that would work better and more properly for this website. I only used some of the original HTML, CSS, and SVGs, the integration of these elements to the server is my original code, and this is the only part of the website that was not originally written by me.
